### Ideal flow of the learning track

We should probably also look into getting an environment started in order to get started with java.

- installing an IDE
- Installing a JRE/SDK for java. This can be a bit of a hassle in Windows (at least it used to be)
- Create a wide variety of small and simple java programs (the famous public static void main()). They need to understand that this method is the 'entry point' of java programs. Getting to know the primitive data types, for loops, while loops, do-while loops, etc.
- To keep things interesting, I would fairly soon start to show them how read files from a file system, so there are more possibilities for small but interesting java programs (automating things). For example, reading in csv files. Reading in files and writing to files will be a big leap this early, but on the other hand: there isn't much 'understanding' to it and it brings a few new concepts with it such as exceptions and error handling/thinking. They will need to learn what a try/catch/final block is.
- From csv files (who generally represent related data), I would think it is fairly easy to go to the concept of classes vs objects and data modelling. At least an introduction to it. From there on, we go to inheritance with subclasses/subtypes and composition/abstraction with interfaces.
- Interfaces are the way into collections and generics.

### goals for week 1:

- Be able to install java and an IDE

- Be able to write, compile and run a program

- Understand what imports are

- syntax: java syntax should already be familiar
    * primitive data types (there are 8)
    * Assigning variables with primitive data types
    * Object version of those data types (Integer, String, Long, etc) and arrays
    * Assigning variables of reference types.
    * Using arrays
    * Prefix and postfix forms
    * if/else statements
    * loops: for loops, while loops, do-while loops
    * making methods: signature of a method, return type, parameters
    * Comments: be able to write comments

- Be able to read and respond to a stack trace

- Working with Strings (splitting)

- writing java programs that can automate simple things

- understand classes vs objects, abstract classes, interfaces and what they are for.

- understand method signatures

- Introduce the access modifiers (now that we are talking about classes) ! maybe move this to week 3 when introducing encapsulation.

- Introduce what coupling is (I would create a simple task/challenge that makes coupling clear) ! lets postpone this

    introduce collections (List, Set, Map, ...)

- introduce generics (part 1: using generics)

- introduce exceptions (What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?)

- introduce error handling with try/catch/final --- > what is so special about that final block?
